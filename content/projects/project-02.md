# Abstract

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification. The model was trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset and achieves over 85% accuracy on the test set.

## Technology Stack

- **Python** for programming
- **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for deep learning
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization
- **NumPy** for numerical computations

## Model Architecture

The model consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling, batch normalization, and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
