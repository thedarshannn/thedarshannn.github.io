I’m in my last semester of the Computer Engineering Technology program at Humber College, figuring out life as an international student in Canada. Right now, I’m deep into my capstone project, Smart Sprout—a smart gardening system that helps plants thrive with tech.

I’m on the lookout for an entry-level job in tech where I can put my skills to work and keep learning. I also love sharing what I build through tech blogs and GitHub projects.

Let’s connect and talk tech, projects, or just geek out over cool ideas! 🚀
